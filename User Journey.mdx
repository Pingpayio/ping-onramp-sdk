## How it Works

Ping leverages NEAR Intents and the Coinbase API, to enable seamless fiat-to-crypto Onramps.

Users deposit their fiat currency in order to receive native USDC on the Base, for zero fees -meaning you receive your full fiat amount in USDC on Base without any deductions.

**Now Ping takes over:** If your ultimate goal was ton Onramp into USDC on Base, then great – the USDC can go straight to your wallet on Base. But if your goal was a different asset or a different blockchain (e.g., NEAR on the NEAR blockchain), the USDC on Base is then routed through the Intents network and swapped into that preferred asset and destination wallet in less than 30 seconds. 

Users are able to Onramp into any of the “supported assets” if they are in any of the “supported regions”

In the unlikely event where USDC on Base is routed through the Intents Network and swaps fail, the USDC on Base funds can be recovered directly from:
```bash
https://near-intents.org/
```

**Note:** At no point does Ping take custody of your fiat or cryptocurrency. The fiat goes to the regulated provider (like Coinbase), and the crypto goes directly to you via the Intents Network.
