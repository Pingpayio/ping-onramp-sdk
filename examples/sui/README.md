# Pingpay Onramp SDK Examples

This directory contains a simple example to demonstrate how to integrate and use the `@pingpay/onramp-sdk`.

## Overview

The example is a basic HTML page with a TypeScript script that showcases the essential steps for setting up and launching the Pingpay onramp flow. It provides a practical, hands-on reference for developers looking to integrate the SDK into their own applications.

## How to Run the Example

1.  **Navigate to the `examples` directory**:
    ```bash
    cd examples
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies**:
    This example uses `bun` as the package manager.
    ```bash
    bun install
    ```

3.  **Run the development server**:
    This will start a local development server using Vite.
    ```bash
    bun run dev
    ```

4.  **Open your browser**:
    Navigate to the URL provided by the development server (usually `http://localhost:5173`). You will see a simple page with a "Start Onramp" button.
