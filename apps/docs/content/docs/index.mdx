Ping provides a full suite of consumer focussed tools for users, merchants, agents and developers to send/receive instant, borderless crypto & fiat payments - while allowing seamless management of money across any blockchain.

**Core features include:**
- Payment Links & Embeddable Widgets
- Intent Based Payments
- Chain Abstracted Onramp
- Swaps & Multi-chain Asset Management
- Automated Subscriptions

### “Pay Your Way”

The **“payer”** pays in their preferred currency (whether it be crypto or fiat) and the **“payee”** receives the funds in their preferred currency. With Ping, there is no need to worry about matching currencies, wallets, or blockchains. Intents abstract away the complexity of cross-chain payments, letting users focus on the transaction - not the technology.

Ping removes the barriers that have traditionally made global payments slow, fragmented, and painful. Payment flows just work, regardless of chains, tokens, or currencies. One Ping At A Time.
