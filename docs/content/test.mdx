The Ping Onramp is a chain-abstracted onramp SDK designed to easily integrate a seamless fiat-to-crypto onramp experience directly within any application. It enables users/agents to purchase any near intents supported currencies directly with their Fiat.

By leveraging NEAR Intents and the Coinbase Onramp API, users deposit fiat to receive native USDC on Base (for zero fees), which then gets routed to the NEAR Intents network - allowing users to receive their asset on their preferred blockchain and wallet in less than 30 seconds for just the Intents network fee.

Ping seeks to aggregate fiat payment options to become a seamless global entry point into DeFi ecosystems, while streamlining the onboarding process.

### Key Features Include:

- Out-of-the-box support for Coinbase Onramp, allowing users to initiate fiat-to-crypto purchases directly inside their applications (Coinbase Onramp used since the USDC on Base zero fee structure allows near-zero fees within applications, even after a swap into a NEAR Intents destination asset.
- Powered by NEAR Intents, allowing for fast, gas-efficient cross-chain delivery to the user's preferred wallet. Buy with Fiat, land anywhere via intents
- Developers can pass in pre-defined parameters such as wallet address, target token (e.g. NEAR, USDC), and support any blockchain NEAR, Ethereum, BTC, and more - enabling a simplistic user journey. It is easily extendable to support multiple tokens and networks as new providers are added.
- Onramp component that can be embedded directly into any frontend. Supports full styling control, dynamic parameters, and both inline modal and full-page redirect flows.
- Developers can attach optional event handlers to each step of the Onramp flow, enabling tight UX feedback.
